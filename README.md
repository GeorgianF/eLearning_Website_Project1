The Learning Project is a landing website where anyone can be challenged to learn and develop themself.
The idea behind the website is that you, as a customer, register the information about yourself annd the subject interested to learn and we will provide will material for you to learn from all over the web.

It does not have a targeted age group, it's universal.
