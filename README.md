# CONNECT eLearning

The Learning Project is a landing website where anyone can be challenged to learn and develop themself.
The idea behind the website is that you, as a customer, register the information about yourself and the subject interested to learn, and we will provide will material for you to learn from all over the web.

It does not have a targeted age group, it's universal, because there is a vast range of things that you can do.

Users will find on the website information about our mission, the courses available (but I only put 5 categories, with 5 subcategories) for more courses they have to submit the form that they can find on the register page.
They can also find a page with the subscription plan.

When chosing the main contrast of colors I used the websites:

https://mycolor.space/ 
https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0

Navivation: 
Top-left corner there si the logo, that it's animated, with an link to the index.html page.
In the top-right corner where there are link to other pages likes Courses, Plans, Register, but also Home. 
There are styled like a button, once you hover over them, the color changes. The font and color are in contrast with each other.
The navigation, tells the visitor where he can find the certain section, within the website, easy to find.

The first page, Home page, is structured in different sections:

**Section 1: About** 

The user will find a short wisdom phrase about the learning process, and a button that will send him to the courses page.

**Section 2 and 4: Features**

The features sections are mentioned two times within the first page, so the user sees the advantages of chosing the learning plan.

**Section 3: Media**

There is a video, from youtube, insight on future education.
The link for the video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO4l5XpOc-s&t=2s

**Testing**: 

* I've tested to see if the page it's working in different browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari.
* I've confirm that the page is responsive using the Dev Tools.
* I confirm that all the navigation and content are easy readable and have a balance of contrast.
* I confirm that the form works, but once the button is submited it does not have a server to go to, so it displays an error 405 - Not Allowed.

### BUGS

When I deployed to page the github pages the images on the index.html did not displayed. 
The problem was the link used for the background image, had to add "../" in front of the image folder.
